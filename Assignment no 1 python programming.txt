ASSINMENT NO 1 PYTHON PROGRAMMING


1. Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output).
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
                     How I wonder what you are!
                               Up above the world so high,
                                   Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
                       How I wonder what you are
ANS:
a = "twinkle, twinkle, little star,"
b = "    how i wonder what you are!"
c = "       up above the world so high"
d = "           like a diamond in the sky."
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
print(a)
print(b)
twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    how i wonder what you are!
       up above the world so high
           like a diamond in the sky.
twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    how i wonder what you are!


3. Write a Python program to display the current date and time.

ANS:
import datetime 
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print(now)
2019-11-02 15:00:16.455585

5. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.
ANS :
fname = input ("input your first name :")
iname = input ("input your last name:")
print (iname +" " +fname)

output
input your first name :Arain
input your last name:Zeeshan
Zeeshan Arain




4. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.
ANS:
from math import pi
r = float(input ("Input the radius of the circle : "))
print ("The area of the circle with radius " + str(r) + " is: " + str(pi * r**2))

Input the radius of the circle : 1.1
The area of the circle with radius 1.1 is: 3.8013271108436504



6. Write a python program which takes two inputs from user and print them
Addition.

ANS:
num1 = input('Enter first number: ')
num2 = input('Enter second number: ')
sum = float(num1) + float(num2)
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))
OUTPUT
Enter first number: 2.3
Enter second number: 2.3
The sum of 2.3 and 2.3 is 4.6



2. Write a Python program to get the Python version you are using.
ANS:
import sys
print ( "python version" )
print (sys.version)

output 
python version
3.7.4 (default, Aug  9 2019, 18:34:13) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)]
