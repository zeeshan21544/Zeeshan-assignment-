English = int(input("enter your marks of english out of 100 = "))
urdu = int(input("enter your marks of urdu out of 100 = "))
math = int(input("enter your marks of math out of 100 = "))
physics = int(input("enter your marks of physics out of 100 = "))
chemistry = int(input("enter your marks of chemistry out of 100 = "))
total_marks=English+urdu+math+physics+chemistry
percentage= (total_marks/500)*100
print("your total marks are" + str(total_marks))
print("your percentage is" + " " + str(percentage))

if  percentage >=90 and percentage <= 100 :
       print("congratulation! you have secured A")
elif percentage <90 and percentage >=80 :
       print("congratulation! you have secured B")
elif percentage <80 and percentage >=70 :
       print("congratulation! you have secured C")
elif percentage >=60 and percentage <=60:
       print("congratulation! you have secured D")
else:
      print("you are fail")

number is even or odd?

ANS:

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print("{0} is Even".format(num))
else:
   print("{0} is Odd".format(num))

ANS:
list=[22,21,33,44,55]
print(len(list))



4. Write a Python program to sum all the numeric items in a list?


ANS:
list=[22,21,33,4,55]
x=len(list)
sum=0
for i in range (x):
    sum=sum+list[i]
print("sum of list=",sum)



5. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a numeric list.


ANS:
list=[22,21,33,44,55]
print(max(list))



6. Take a list, say for example this one:
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are
less than 5.

ANS:

list=[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]
x=len(list)
for i in range(x):
    if list[i]<5:
        print(list[i])
